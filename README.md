_Platform for learning languages with native speakers_

The starting point of the project was the love to languages. It so happened that I often communicate with foreign students and enjoy languages. I attended more than one language courses and caught myself thinking that the best way to learn a language is to speak with a native speaker.

I had an idea to create a platform for people who want to attend events with native speakers and improve their speech. This application should act as a platform for organizing events, meetings and clubs with native speakers. The best way to bring a foreign language to perfection is to speak it.

On this site you can create or find an event, register and take part in it. It is also planned to include a section with private teachers and information on language courses.
